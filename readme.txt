About role membership
---------------------
I approve anyone to be an observer, but generally deny requests for developer
access preferring more controlled access to CVS. My standard reply is:
Hi,
I have generaly worked on open source projects using a patch system rather than very open CVS which often ends up with much wasted time spent on resolving developer conflicts, and I'd like to use that model on this project too.
Thanks,
Joe.
