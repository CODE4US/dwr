Multiple call issue
	When calling the same function 4 times consecutively passing a different
	paramter the same result is always returned.  While debugging on the server side
	(jboss), I have noted that the result passed back (a collection) is different.
	However, DWR appears to be getting confused and always returns the same result
	for each call.
	I have noticed that if I put each call between a begin/endbatch that the correct
	result is returned.
	This is only for 1.1.  1.0 does not have this issue.

problems with oc4j??
	This is a berif description and I will send you my code soon.
	In my code I'm trying to call a java method from the jscript, where the java
	method returns a vector of objects and the returned value is reterived from
	the database, so every time the returned vector size could be changed, but
	in my case the returned vector has the same size every time however I'm sure
	that this vector is changed. What I could understand till now that this
	problem still accoured even I have restarted the jDeveloper and the whole
	windows.
	Thank you for your interest, and I will send you the code ASAP.

IFrame GET is broken with Safari
	iframe is only really useful with IE6 (with activex turned off) so we can
	ignore this breakage
