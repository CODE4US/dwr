Removed deprecated.js

Refactored to abstract out the wire protocol. By default DWR still uses it's own
slighty JSONish protocol, but it should be possible for someone to create a
tweak that makes DWR run over SOAP or JSON-RPC or whatever you want.

Applied the XssScript patch. This enables a 3rd remoting scheme. DWR could
previously use XHR or iframe remoting. Now we also support script tag remoting.
NOTE: I've changed the name from XssScript to ScriptTag because XSS has the
implication of a secuity hole, and I don't want people to think that we are
exploiting a security hole.
