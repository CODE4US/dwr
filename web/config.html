<h2>DWR (Direct Web Remoting)</h2>

<pre>

&lt;!--
Top level conviguration element.
-->
&lt;!ELEMENT dwr (
    init, allow
)>

&lt;!--
A list of all the classes to configure as part of dwr at startup time.
-->
&lt;!ELEMENT init (
    (creator | converter)*
)>

&lt;!--
Define a new method of creating objects for use by Javascript.
We don't just allow access to any object and some may need special code to
get a reference to them.
-->
&lt;!ELEMENT creator EMPTY>
&lt;!ATTLIST creator
    id ID #REQUIRED
    class CDATA #REQUIRED
>

&lt;!--
Define a new way of converting between javascript objects and java objects.
Many classes can have default conversion mechanisms but some require more
custom conversion
-->
&lt;!ELEMENT converter EMPTY>
&lt;!ATTLIST converter
    id ID #REQUIRED
    class CDATA #REQUIRED
    priority CDATA #IMPLIED
>

&lt;!--
Security: we must define which classes we are allowed to access because a
free-for-all will be very dangerous.
-->
&lt;!ELEMENT allow (
    (create | convert)*
)>

&lt;!--
Allow the creation of a class, and give it a name in javascript land.
A reference to a creator is required as are some parameters specific to each
creator that define the objects it allows creation of.
It would be nice to make the creator and IDREF rather than a CDATA, since it
refers to an element defined elsewhere, however we allow multiple dwr.xml
files and we might refer to one in another file.
-->
&lt;!ELEMENT create ANY>
&lt;!ATTLIST create
    creator CDATA #REQUIRED
    javascript CDATA #REQUIRED
    class CDATA #IMPLIED
    beanName CDATA #IMPLIED
>

&lt;!--
Allow conversion of a class between Java and Javascript.
A convert element uses a previously defined converter and gives a class match
pattern (which can end with *) to define the classes it allows conversion of
It would be nice to make the converter and IDREF rather than a CDATA, since it
refers to an element defined elsewhere, however we allow multiple dwr.xml
files and we might refer to one in another file.
-->
&lt;!ELEMENT convert EMPTY>
&lt;!ATTLIST convert
    converter CDATA #REQUIRED
    match CDATA #REQUIRED
>
